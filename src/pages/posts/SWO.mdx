# The Concept  
   The idea of creating a compiled programming language began to take shape in May of 2022. At that time, I had no major projects in development (except for, as required by every developer, dozens of abandoned half-baked ideas). At this time, I was desperately searching for new ideas. Finding myself unable to come up with anything new, and feeling incredibly bored, I decided to make an attempt at something I had been wanting to do for a while. This task seemed daunting, however, as I would later learn, was not nearly as hard as I thought it would be. Thus, SWO, aka SWO Wants Options, my compiled programming language, came into existence.

# The Beginning 
   When I first started, I had a few major decisions to make. Did I want to build a compiled language, an interpreted one, or transpile it? What language was my compiler going to be written in? Did I want to follow a tutorial, or wing it? After some deliberation, I decided that I would write my compiler in C##. I had a decent amount of C# experience from my time making games in Unity, and I felt that OOP could be helpful. Once I chose the implementation language, all that was left was to choose how my language (SWO) would work. For me, I was able to understand compilation much easier and quicker than in interpretation. This left me with two choices, a transpiled language and a compiled one. In the end, I decided to go with a compiled language for the extra challenge. Naturally, with a compiled language, I decided to target LLVM IR and use the LLVM C-API C# bindings (known as LLVMSharp).

# First Months
    My first months of development on my compiler were marked by turmoil and constant rewriting. Due to the fact that I knew next to nothing about parsers, compilers, LLVM, and low level programming and general, development pace can best be described as slow. I also didn't want to spend weeks studying LLVM and low level programming; I find the easiest (and most fun way) to learn is through actual programming. I have never read a programming book, and generally, when I am learning something new, I like to just dive straight in with a project. While this might not be the most efficient way of learning, it is my favorite way. Now that you have the background for SWO, I will try to get more into the actual development (and be a little less boring). In these first few months, I found several useful resources:
    * [LLVM Kaleidoscope Tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/)
        * While I didn't know C at the time I used this guide, It was still very helpful for figuring out how the LLVM API worked.
    * [LLVMSharp Kaleidoscope Tutorial]()
        * This tutorial is simply a clone of the LLVM Kaleidoscope Tutorial, and altough it only contains the first few chapters, I still found it helpful to have the Kaleidoscope Tutorial in a language I understood.
