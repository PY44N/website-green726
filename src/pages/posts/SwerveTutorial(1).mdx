# Under Construction

# Overview
In this post, I will go over what this tutorial series will entail, and introduce some swerve drive concepts. 
# Introduction
Writing code for a swerve drive train can be difficult. This difficulty level increases exponentially when you throw in autonomous and odometry. For this reason, WPILib provides some nice swerve druve utility classes. However, what happens if the WPILib swerve libraries don't function? What if you need a greater range of customization than WPILib can offer? What if you want to truly understand how a swerve drive train functions? The solution to all of these questions, unfortunately, is to create a swerve drive train controller from scratch. When my team (2875) wanted to use a swerve drive robot, but the WPILib libraries were not functioning (they did not allow translation and rotation at the same time), we were forced to do this. Unfortunately, we lacked programmers with any experience. This meant that we had to spend several months trial-and-erroring our way through creating a custom swerve drive train controller. To prevent future teams from needing to undertake that, I am writing this tutorial series on writing a custom swerve drive train controller. 
# What is Swerve Drive?
Swerve drive is a form of drive train used in FRC robotics. It is generally regarded as the most complex drive train (to build, program, and drive); however, it is also considered to be the most agile. For this to happen, swerve drive utilizes a four-wheel configuration. This four wheel configuration is by no means standard, however. Each wheel (or "module" as they are reffered to) has two seperate motors. One motor is used to drive the wheel (rotate it vertically), while the other motor is used to control the angle of the wheel (rotate it horizontally). This allows each wheel to independently rotate, and drive in any direction. This comes together and not only allows the robot to deftly translate and rotate, but do both at the same time. "But wait, isn't that just mecanum?". Yes, swerve drive offers similar capabiites, however, it also offers increased speed, mobility, and traction. The sole downside of swerve drive (other than its complexity) is its lack of traction/power when compared to tank drive. In short: don't get into a ramming contest with a swerve drive robot - the swerve drive will lose. 
# Components of Swerve
Swerve drive has three major components:
## Train
## Module
## Odometry
Througout the course of this tutorial, you will learn how to program each one.
# Prerequisite Knowledge
