# Under Construction

# Overview
In this post, I will go over what this tutorial series will entail, and introduce some swerve drive concepts. 
# Introduction
Writing code for a swerve drive train can be difficult. This difficulty level increases exponentially when you throw in autonomous and odometry. For this reason, WPILib provides some nice swerve druve utility classes. However, what happens if the WPILib swerve libraries don't function? What if you need a greater range of customization than WPILib can offer? What if you want to truly understand how a swerve drive train functions? The solution to all of these questions, unfortunately, is to create a swerve drive train controller from scratch. When my team (2875) wanted to use a swerve drive robot, but the WPILib libraries were not functioning (they did not allow translation and rotation at the same time), we were forced to do this. Unfortunately, we lacked programmers with any experience. This meant that we had to spend several months trial-and-erroring our way through creating a custom swerve drive train controller. To prevent future teams from needing to undertake that, I am writing this tutorial series on writing a custom swerve drive train controller.
